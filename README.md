# VIT_Token
In this project, we have developed our cryptocurrency using Solidity, an object-oriented programming language, for writing Smart Contracts. The currency complies with the ERC-20 Token Standard provided by Ethereum. Once the Smart contract was in place, we created APIs for the transactions that will take place. Side by Side, we worked on the UI/UX which allows end-users to buy and interact with VIT token smoothly without any hassle. A technology Stack of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap has been used. Since we want this to be as transparent as possible, we will be Open Sourcing our code completely so that people can have a look at it anytime and our fellow developers can help us make it better over time and be a part of this revolution. By the end of our project, VIT token will be hosting its ICO (Initial Coin Offering) on our webpage.
